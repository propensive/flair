// This is deliberately not a rule: none of what it counts is a violation.
// A project that concentrates its unsafety behind a small set of named
// constructs still needs to know how much is behind them, and whether that
// is growing — a question no per-file diagnostic can answer, because the
// answer is a number over the whole corpus.
//
// What is counted is what the project's configuration defines: every project
// rule, enforced or not, under its name; and for every gate, the definitions
// it gates and the definitions that claim it without being gated. The counts
// are therefore a gauge rather than a census of semantics — good enough to
// see a trend, and not to be read as anything finer.
