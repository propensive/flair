# Flair

**Flair** is a linter for Scala 3, in the same family as [fume](https://github.com/propensive/fume)
and [flame](https://github.com/propensive/flame). It checks sources against **Consequent Style**
— a syntax and formatting standard whose rules are *derived from principles about how code is
read* rather than applied by a reformatter — and against a project's own rules, defined in a
few lines of TEL. It runs as a command, `flair`, and as a compiler plugin, and it keeps a census
of a project's rules in git notes so that the counts can be followed commit by commit.

- [Rule reference](/doc/rules/)
- [Releasing](/doc/releasing.md)

## Installing

```sh
curl -fsSL https://flair.propensive.dev/ | sh
```

installs the `flair` executable for your platform (macOS or Linux, x64 or arm64) into
`~/.local/bin` (or `$FLAIR_INSTALL_DIR`), verifying it against the digest published with the
release. Each [GitHub release](https://github.com/propensive/flair/releases) also carries the
per-platform executables, the `flair` polyglot bootstrap script, and the library jars. The
first run fetches flair's externalized dependencies; later runs start instantly. `flair install`
adds tab-completions and a manpage to your shell.

## Configuration

Flair reads `.pyrocosm/flair/config.tel` from the working directory or the nearest ancestor
holding one, so it can be run from anywhere inside a project. `.pyrocosm` is the project's
shared directory, one subdirectory per tool. The file defines the project's **rules** and the
**profiles** that check them:

```
tel 1.0

# ── Rules ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A rule is a named detection over the parse tree. Each child line is a predicate; the rule
# matches wherever any predicate does. A rule is checked only where a profile enforces it, but
# `flair metrics` counts every rule's matches regardless, so a rule may exist purely to be
# measured.

rule cast
  invokes asInstanceOf
  invokes isInstanceOf
  message  Casts bypass the type checker; prefer a pattern match

rule unsafe
  invokes unsafely
  annotates unsafeAssumePure
  invokes unsafe*                 # every unsafe-prefixed call, counted under this rule
  severity error                  # when enforced; warn otherwise

rule imperative
  uses var
  uses while
  uses throw
  uses catch-all

# ── Profiles ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# What `flair` checks. With one profile, `flair` runs it; with several, `flair <name>`.

profile default
  source lib/*/src/**/*.scala     # globs relative to the project root; `**` spans directories
  source src/**/*.scala
  exclude lib/*/res/**
  language experimental.modularity          # -language features, as the build passes them
  language experimental.captureChecking
  notes flair                               # the git notes namespace (this is the default)

  style consequent                # the formatting standard, with its refinements beneath
    header etc/header.txt         # the licence header every file must begin with, verbatim
    columns 100
    umbrella soundness            # the umbrella re-export package (enables L4 and L5)
    module-root lib               # the segment below which each module has its own directory
    interpolator m                # interpolators whose interior whitespace is insignificant
    omit L4                       # leave a rule out (or a whole principle: `omit S`)
    strict F4                     # report a rule as an error
    severity warn                 # the default severity of the style's rules: warn | error
    gate Unsafe                   # S1: a `using` parameter of type Unsafe must pair with a
      prefix unsafe               # name beginning `unsafe`, and vice versa; repeatable

  enforce cast                    # a rule this profile checks
  enforce unsafe
    severity warn                 # overriding the rule's own severity, for this profile
```

### Predicates

Every predicate names one shape on the untyped parse tree (or, for `matches`, on the text), so
no rule needs the type checker. Names are matched on their simple (last) segment and may use
`*` as a wildcard.

| Keyword | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `invokes <name>` | a method reference in call or selection position: `x.name(…)`, `name(…)`, infix `a name b`, a bare `x.name` |
| `references <name>` | any identifier or selection naming `<name>`, including type positions and imports |
| `annotates <Name>` | an annotation `@Name` on a definition or expression |
| `instantiates <Type>` | `new Type(…)`, or `Type(…)` where `Type` is capitalised |
| `extends <Type>` | a class, trait, object or enum with `Type` among its parents |
| `derives <Type>` | a `derives Type` clause |
| `imports <path>` | an import of `path` or anything beneath it |
| `defines <name>` | a `def`, `val`, `var`, `given`, `type`, class, trait, object or enum named `<name>` |
| `overrides <name>` | an `override` definition named `<name>` |
| `uses <construct>` | a construct: `var`, `null`, `throw`, `return`, `while`, `try`, `catch-all`, `implicit`, `lazy`, `abstract-type`, `wildcard-import`, `by-name`, `default-argument`, `symbolic-name` |
| `matches <regex>` | a regular expression over each source line |

A rule may also carry a `message` (shown in place of the default) and a `severity` (`warn`,
the default, or `error`). A profile's `enforce` may override the severity.

## Running

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `flair` / `flair <profile>` / `flair check [profile] [paths…]` | checks the profile's sources; paths restrict the check to files beneath them |
| `flair metrics [profile]` | counts every rule and gate across the profile's sources and records the census in git notes |
| `flair metrics [profile] --show <commit\|tree>` | prints the census recorded for a commit or input tree |
| `flair options [profile]` | prints the `-P:flair:` options equivalent to the profile, for the compiler plugin |
| `flair rules [profile]` | lists the style's rules and the project's, with their severities |
| `flair install` | installs tab-completions and the manpage |

`check` reports each finding with a highlighted excerpt, then a table of the rules that fired.
While it runs in a terminal, it shows a board — Pyrocosm's `Board`, the same one fume shows a
test run on — whose content panel scrolls the findings as each file is checked and whose status
panel gauges how many files have been parsed and then checked; the report is printed once the
board closes. `metrics` shows the same board for parsing and counting, listing each file's
counts as they arrive. With `--terse`, or under GitHub Actions, or when the output is not a
terminal, it prints one `path:line:column: level: [rule] message` line per finding instead,
with no board. It exits non-zero when any error-severity rule fired
(status 1) or a source failed to parse (status 5).

The compiler is invoked on the profile's sources and stopped after the last phase any enabled
rule needs — the parser, for every rule so far — so a check costs a parse and needs no
classpath.

### The census and git notes

`flair metrics` counts, per file, the matches of every rule the configuration defines (enforced
or not) and, for every gate, the definitions it gates and those that claim it without being
gated (`<prefix>-gate`, `<prefix>-ungated`). None of this is a violation; the question it
answers is how much code sits behind a project's escape hatches and whether that is growing.

The result is recorded in git notes under `refs/notes/flair` (or the profile's `notes`
namespace) in two parts: the census itself, a TEL document attached to the **git tree object of
exactly the input files**, so identical inputs across commits share one measurement and are
never measured twice; and a pointer note appended to the HEAD commit naming the profile, the
tree and the time, which is what a walk of the history follows to plot a series. `--dry-run`
prints the census without writing; `--force` replaces an existing tree note. Notes are shared
like any ref:

```sh
git push origin refs/notes/flair
git fetch origin refs/notes/flair:refs/notes/flair
```

The input tree is a dangling object that `git gc` may prune; the notes survive, and `--show`
reads them through the notes ref itself.

## The compiler plugin

The same rules run inside the compiler, as `dev.propensive:flair-plugin`. The plugin has no
TEL parser — it is loaded into the compiler that builds Soundness, so it depends on nothing but
the compiler — and takes its configuration as `-P:flair:` options, which `flair options` prints
from the project's profile:

```scala
def scalacPluginMvnDeps = Seq(mvn"dev.propensive:flair-plugin:$version")
def scalacOptions = super.scalacOptions() ++ os.proc("flair", "options").call().out.lines()
```

Violations are reported as warnings, or errors where the profile says so. The option syntax is
the plugin's own: `;` separates a list's items (the compiler splits `-P` on commas before the
plugin sees them) and `:` separates a value's fields — `header=<file>`, `columns=<n>`,
`umbrella=<pkg>`, `moduleRoot=<segment>`, `language=a;b`, `interpolators=m;j`,
`gate=Unsafe:unsafe`, `strict=F4;S`, `omit=L4`, `rule=cast:invokes:asInstanceOf`,
`rule=cast:message:<text>`, `rule=cast:severity:error`, `enforce=cast` or `enforce=cast:error`,
and `errors`.

## Modules

`plugin` and `client` are released to GitHub Releases under `dev.propensive` (as
`flair-plugin` and `flair-client`), using the same publishing settings as Soundness.

- **`plugin`** — the compiler plugin and the lint engine behind it: Consequent Style's rules,
  the predicate engine for project rules, and the census. Plain Scala against the compiler
  alone, with no Soundness dependency.
- **`client`** — the command's library: the configuration reader, the compiler front end,
  the [Pyrocosm](https://github.com/propensive/pyrocosm) report, and the git notes.
- **`launcher`** — the invocation point, alone in its own module: just
  `@main def flair = externalize(runClient())`. It depends on `client`/`plugin` as **published
  coordinates** (resolved from `~/.ivy2/local`), so Burdock's `externalize` records their jar
  hashes and the repackager turns them into on-demand downloads rather than inlining them.
- **`test`** — a [Probably](https://github.com/propensive/probably) test suite.

## Building

```sh
make run ARGS='rules'        # publish libs locally, build & run the command (no release needed)
make test-plain              # compile and run the test suite
make test                    # the same, through fume
make flair                   # assemble, repackage with Burdock, emit the `flair` executable
make install                 # copy it to ~/.local/bin
make release VERSION=X.Y.Z   # publish a release to GitHub Releases (see doc/releasing.md)
```

The build compiles with the [proscala](https://github.com/propensive/proscala) fork of the Scala
compiler (the toolchain Soundness itself is built with), downloaded on demand from its GitHub
release and cached under `~/.cache/soundness/proscala`. Soundness and Pyrocosm are resolved as
per-component jars from `~/.ivy2/local`, installed from their GitHub Releases by `make
sync-deps` at the versions pinned in `etc/refs` (or by `make publishLocal` in a checkout).

Flair checks itself: `.pyrocosm/flair/config.tel` applies Consequent Style to its own sources.
