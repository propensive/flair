# Rule reference

Every rule has an identifier of the form `<principle><number>` — the letter of
the principle it derives from, then its number within that principle. A rule
with several distinct failures adds a third component: `A2.1`, `A9.3`.

Numbering within a principle follows the order of Part II of
[the standard](../consequent-style.md). The number carries no meaning beyond
identity, and is stable: a rule keeps its identifier even if the section order
changes.

## F — The Frame

*The fixed shape every file sits in.*

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| [`F1`](F1.md) | Licence-header block comment |
| [`F2`](F2.md) | `package` declaration on line `header + 1` |
| [`F3`](F3.md) | Blank line after `package` |
| [`F4`](F4.md) | Line length |
| [`F5`](F5.md) | Tab characters |
| [`F6`](F6.md) | Indent width must be even |
| [`F7`](F7.md) | Trailing whitespace |
| [`F8`](F8.md) | Block-comment usage |

## A — Anchoring

*Where a continuation line begins.*

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| [`A1`](A1.md) | Continuation indent |
| [`A2`](A2.md) | Keyword-sequence layout |
| [`A3`](A3.md) | Type-annotation anchor |

| [`A7`](A7.md) | `given` continuation alignment |
| [`A8`](A8.md) | Multi-line interpolated-string layout |
| [`A9`](A9.md) | Quote and splice layout |

## D — Density

*How much to fit on one line.*

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| [`D1`](D1.md) | Unnecessary line break |
| [`D2`](D2.md) | Lambda bracketing |

## C — Continuation Marking

*Showing that a line is unfinished.*

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| [`C1`](C1.md) | `.method` continuation lines |
| [`C2`](C2.md) | Symbolic infix operator continuation |
| [`C3`](C3.md) | Continuation indents after `=>` and heavy `:` |

## B — Balance

*Symmetry of spacing around a token.*

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| [`B1`](B1.md) | Operator spacing |
| [`B2`](B2.md) | Assignment spacing |
| [`B3`](B3.md) | Single space between specific tokens |
| [`B4`](B4.md) | Multi-line block bracket spacing |
| [`B5`](B5.md) | Bracket inner spacing |

## P — Proximity

*Blank lines and gaps as grouping.*

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| [`P1`](P1.md) | Spacing around commas |
| [`P2`](P2.md) | Blank-line spacing between sibling declarations |
| [`P3`](P3.md) | Too many consecutive blank lines |
| [`P4`](P4.md) | Blank line after heavy-signature return type |
| [`P5`](P5.md) | Blank line after imports |
| [`P6`](P6.md) | Annotations and following declarations |

## T — Tabulation

*Vertical alignment across a run of lines.*

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| [`T1`](T1.md) | `=>` alignment in case run |
| [`T2`](T2.md) | `using`-clause alignment |
| [`T3`](T3.md) | `for`-comprehension layout |

## L — Locatability

*Finding a definition from its name.*

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| [`L1`](L1.md) | Top-level import rules |
| [`L2`](L2.md) | File naming conventions |
| [`L3`](L3.md) | `object` must precede `class`/`trait`/`enum` of same name |
| [`L4`](L4.md) | Definition not exported to the umbrella package |
| [`L5`](L5.md) | Extension method not exported to the umbrella package |

## S — Soundness

*What the code claims about itself.*

Unlike the other principles, these rules are about meaning rather than
layout, and they are inert until the project tells the plugin what its
unsafe token is.

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| [`S1`](S1.md) | Unsafe naming |

## Suppressing a rule

There is no per-site suppression. A rule that is wrong for a project should be
raised as an issue; a rule that depends on a project parameter — the
licence-header length, the column limit, the umbrella package — is configured
through the plugin options listed in the [README](../../README.md) rather than
suppressed.

## Migrating from the `SN-` identifiers

These rules were previously numbered in the `SN-nnn` scheme, in which one
number could span several unrelated rules. The old identifiers map onto the
new ones as follows.
