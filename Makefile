# Build the invocation-point `launcher` module as a plain (clean, no shell-preamble) assembly JAR.
# `launcher` depends on flare-client (and, through it, flare-plugin) as PUBLISHED coordinates
# resolved from ~/.ivy2/local, so the libraries are published there FIRST — otherwise the launcher
# silently builds against whatever was last published (a release's jars, say, whose bytes then
# externalize to that release's download, and local changes never reach the executable).
# `clean flare.launcher` for the same reason as in `run`: the coordinate is fixed, so Mill's cached
# resolution would not notice the fresh publish.

# Releases are cut by tagging, not by make. Tag a commit CI has passed, with `git tag -s
# X.Y.Z && git push --tags`: the tag fires .github/workflows/release.yml, which runs the shared
# release.sh in propensive/.github. That gates on a signed tag, on CI already being green on that
# very commit, and on every pin being a release; publishes the library jars; repackages the
# executables against them; and generates the notes. If anything fails, the release and the tag
# are both deleted, so a retry is `git tag -d X.Y.Z && git tag -s X.Y.Z && git push --tags`. What
# this repository needs beyond the common path is declared in etc/release. This target survives
# only to say so.

# Publish the libraries to the local ~/.ivy2 (the launcher resolves them from there; burdock will

# `burdock.externalize` macro wrapping `flare.flare` (in src/launcher/flare_launcher.scala) has
# already embedded `META-INF/burdock.deps` at compile time; running the repackager rewrites the JAR
# in place so published dependencies become on-demand `Burdock-Require` URLs and unpublished ones
# are inlined from `~/.cache/burdock`.
#
# Four publication homes are consulted: Maven Central (hashes resolved via deps.dev) for the
# third-party dependencies, and — via the `--github` hints — the release assets of the flare,
# Pyrocosm, Soundness and proscala repositories, whose per-jar SHA-256 digests the repackager
# matches against the classpath. Set GITHUB_TOKEN to lift the API rate limit.
